# Project Description

## Name: Deepanshu
## Project Title: Effect of Neutron star jet on Common Envelope Evolution (CEE)
## Supervisor: Dr. Luke Chamandy

In this project, we aim to investigate the impact of a neutron star jet on the Common Envelope Evolution (CEE) process. The Common Envelope Evolution occurs in binary star systems where one star expands and engulfs its companion within its envelope. This interaction leads to the formation of a close binary system, which can undergo various evolutionary paths.

## Common Envelope Evolution (CEE)

Common Envelope Evolution (CEE) is a crucial phase in the binary star evolution, which involves the envelope of one star engulfing its companion. During this phase, the orbital energy of the binary system is transferred to the envelope, resulting in the inspiral and subsequent ejection of the envelope. The CEE process plays a significant role in the formation of compact binaries, such as binary neutron star systems.

## Simulation Runs

The following table shows the details of the simulation runs conducted in this project:
